today I want you to build out an elaborate set of resources + buildings
I'd rather you do something unique, but if all you can do is copy kittens game that's fine too
use the interface, then copy the data structure out into a email or wiki for 'this is what I did'

%h6 resources
[{"name":"Catnip"},{"name":"Wood"}]
%h6 buildings
[{"name":"House","costs":[{"name":"Wood","amount":5}],"produces":[],"consumes":[]}]
%h6 game
{"resources":{},"buildings":{}}
